# patch_bits

**SDIY building blocks.**  
Tiny utility boards for digital and analog synth DIY. Clean up CV, bias your FM, sum your signals, and move on.

## What is this?

A growing collection of micro-PCBs for handling the boring but important stuff in synth building—ADC conditioners, mixers, buffers, inverters, etc.  
Designed for **3.3V systems**, hand-solderable, and meant to disappear into your build.

You can wire them in with four leads and forget they exist.

---

## Philosophy

- Open-source hardware (CERN-OHL-W)
- Built for speed, not purity
- Easy to chain, mount, and mod

---

## Use it

- Build your own from the files
- Order from JLC
- Or [buy a prebuilt one](#) if you’re lazy or busy (no shame)

## License

If you make changes and share them, cool. If you don’t, don’t sell them.
